 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8]\n3'
 *
 * Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers.
 *
 * Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size
 * W, and consists of W consecutive cards.
 *
 * Return true if and only if she can.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= hand.length <= 10000
 * 0 <= hand[i]Â <= 10^9
 * 1 <= W <= hand.length
